- Try using a `TreeMap` and a `HashMap` instead of `MyHashMap`.
  1. Are the resulting word frequencies any different?
  No, there is no different in word frequences.
  2. Is the time performance any different? If so, how would you rank the three implementations (in increasing order of time complexity)?
  Yes there is a diffrenet prefeormances between TreeMap, HashMap,and Myhashmap where MyHashMap is the fastest, then HashMap, and the slowest is TreeMap.
- How are `%` and `Math.floorMod` different? Which works more reliably for computing a hash table index?
    The use of Math.floorMod insures that the result of the function is positive. Math.floorMod works more reliably for hash table index in case of negative numbers.
- What is the time complexity of `MyHashMap.size()`, and how could you make it much more efficient?
    O(n). Where n is the table size.
- How does this implementation compare to one where you would directly use your linked `Node` class from the earlier assignment? Answer briefly in terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance.
In terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance. We think that this implemetation is easy and has better performance. linked 'Node' is better at correctness and reliablity.
